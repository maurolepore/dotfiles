# dotfiles

The goal of dotfiles is to store my public dotfiles.

This is how I usually install my dotfiles on a fresh system:
* Install [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/), login with `gh auth login`, and create a new SSH key.
* Install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
* Clone and install my [dotfiles/](https://github.com/maurolepore/dotfiles).

Other programs I like:
* [`j`](https://github.com/wting/autojum).
* [`f`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff).
* [`tmux`](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/). 
* [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) (install then clone password-store/ into ~ and import the private key).
