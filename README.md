# dotfiles

The goal of dotfiles is to store my public dotfiles.

Setup my most commonly used personal and work dotfiles:
* Install `gh`, login with `gh auth login`, and create a new SSH key.
* Install oh-my-zsh.
* Clone and install my dotfiles/.
* Install `pass`, clone password-store/ into ~, and import the private key.
