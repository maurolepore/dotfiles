# dotfiles

Here I track my public dotfiles, e.g. .Rprofile. I track my private
dotfiles, e.g. .Renviron, in a `private` branch that I push to a
different, private GitHub repository.

Here is how I usually setup a fresh environment:

* Install the `gh` CLI. Login with `gh auth login`, and create a new SSH key.

* Install oh-my-zsh.

* Clone and install my dotfiles, usually the simple version in the `cloud` branch.

* Setup pass.

* Install Docker.
